Fast Single Image Dehazing Using Saturation-Based Transmission Map Estimation 
-------------------------
1) Implemented the above research paper for the dataset present in the Image Dehazing folder
2) Also implemented the RANSAC algorithm from scratch to get the best-fitting line with the input being an image and hence needed to detect points first.
